Dudes in a Corridor Manifesto
    By Kevin O'Mara

This project is to create a "dudes in a corridor"-style game framework.  Example
games include Space Hulk, Incursion, Legions of Steel, Sedition Wars, and
Advanced Space Crusade.
    
Electronic inspiration is gained from the brilliant Alien Assault by Teardown:

Ultimately, I will be creating a 2-player, campaign-based, tactical combat and 
exploration game using my Sector board tiles: http://kevinomara.crevado.com/

-- Primary Goals ---------------------------------------------------------------
-> Practice good coding standards with an eye to:
    - low-coupling and high-cohesion
    - modularity
    - extensibility
-> Create a framework which can easily be adapted/extended to make any other
   "Dudes-in-a-Corridor" type game (i.e. ASC, Incursion, Sedition Wars, etc.)

-- Specific Goals/Features -----------------------------------------------------
-> Ability to create new:
    - factions
    - units
    - weapons/equipment
    - tokens (i.e. rubble, pitfalls, turrets, etc.)
-> 2+ player hotseat and online
-> Ability to use AI
-> Create a user-friendly UI
    - readable icons
    - readily available game information (i.e. unit stats, etc.)
-> Mission-specific goals/objectives
    - i.e. "Flame target room", "Reach point X,Y and extract Z units", etc.
-> Create a "map builder"
    - snap-to-grid
    - drop-in geotiles w/ embedded logic (i.e. wall/open,pathing,etc.) & tokens
    - drop-in individual tile sprites
    - user defined logic (i.e. paint wall/open, etc.)
-> Pre-mission "roster selection"
    - spend points to purchase squads/models + upgrades
    - choose where models are placed in-map (within scenario restrictions)
-> Ability to save games and continue *on any computer*
    - i.e. play + save game here, go to friend's house and continue game
    - note: ramifications of this + custom content?
